Based on a review of user feedback and features from existing random video chat platforms like Omegle, Chatroulette, Monkey, and Camsurf, several key areas for improvement and feature gaps were identified that could be incorporated into your project:

	1.	User Safety & Moderation:
A common complaint across platforms like Omegle and Chatroulette is the lack of strong content moderation, which leads to inappropriate behavior such as harassment, cyberbullying, and privacy breaches. Users consistently express frustration over being exposed to offensive content without proper reporting mechanisms. Implementing advanced moderation tools, possibly using AI to detect inappropriate content, and offering real-time reporting/blocking options could significantly enhance user safety and differentiate your app from competitors ￼ ￼.
	2.	Better Matching Features:
Users desire more control over whom they are matched with. Several apps like Chatspin and Shagle offer basic filters like gender and location, but users still ask for more advanced interest-based matching features. Expanding your app to include customizable filters based on interests, hobbies, or even activities (like games or specific discussions) could improve engagement ￼ ￼.
	3.	User Verification & Anonymity Options:
While many platforms allow complete anonymity, there’s a growing demand for options to verify user profiles, which helps build trust. For instance, integrating profile verification through social media or even an email/phone number system could increase credibility. Additionally, some platforms like Shagle offer creative anonymity features, such as virtual masks, to allow users to hide parts of their faces while interacting ￼. This could be a unique feature to include in your app for users who want to remain partially anonymous but still engage in video chats.
	4.	Mobile Optimization & User Interface:
Apps like Camsurf and Chatroulette have gained positive feedback for their mobile usability. A smooth, intuitive mobile experience is essential for user retention, especially for younger audiences who frequently access these apps via smartphones. Ensuring a high-quality mobile app with easy navigation and minimal lag during video sessions will be crucial ￼ ￼.
	5.	Community & Group Features:
While most platforms focus on one-on-one chats, there is potential to offer group chat rooms or themed discussions. Tinychat, for example, stands out for allowing users to create chat rooms based on specific interests or themes, adding a communal aspect to video chats. Introducing group interactions and themed video chats could encourage longer user sessions and help build a sense of community within your app ￼ ￼.

By focusing on these areas—better safety measures, advanced filtering, profile verification, improved mobile functionality, and community-building features—you can address the current gaps in the random video chat market and create a platform that stands out. These features can be included incrementally after launching your MVP, ensuring you meet user expectations while keeping development manageable.Now that we have the advanced features lets get  on with breaking the mvp septs into spimple small tasks which of the following is te mjors approriate template or is there a different one you wold suggest for this current project ideally with javascript:
